# ✅ Future Your Finance  
## Invisible Financial Stress Detection & Debt Prevention System  

🚀 **Future Your Finance** is an AI-powered fintech solution that detects **invisible financial stress early** using spending habits, transaction patterns, and recurring obligations — then helps prevent debt by providing smart insights, alerts, and personalized recommendations.

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Most people don’t realize they are financially stressed until it becomes serious (loan dependency, missed bills, low savings, or debt traps).

Hidden reasons include:
- Lifestyle inflation without awareness  
- Too many subscriptions and recurring payments  
- EMI and bill pressure silently increasing  
- Irregular spending patterns  
- Poor monthly budgeting habits  

✅ **Future Your Finance** solves this by identifying early warning signals and helping users stay stable **before falling into debt**.

## 💡 Why This Project is Unique?  
Unlike normal expense trackers, this system focuses on **Invisible Financial Stress** — meaning it detects problems before the user feels the impact.

It works like a **financial early-warning system** that protects users from debt.
